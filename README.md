# SQLAlchemy-Challenge

  This project utilizes Pandas, Matplotlib, and SQLAlchemy to perform exploratory analysis on the precipitation and station data of an SQLite database. 


  The project also includes a climate app designed with a Flask API based on the previous queries.
There are static API routes to return JSONified precipitation and station data from the database. Included as well is a dynamic API that returns the min, max, and average temperatures calculated from a given start date to a given end date.
